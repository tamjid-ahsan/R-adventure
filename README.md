# R-adventure 
Getting back to `R` after 2 year break, brushing up skills and picking up new things and paying off tech debts.

# TODO:
- data acquisition using `R`
- keep working on `tidyverse` & it's quarks
- keep exploring `R`
- explore `.R` & `.Rmd` in `VScode` & `Rstudio`
- git branching and merging
